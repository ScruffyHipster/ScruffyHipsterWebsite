  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

  <p><strong>Rewire</strong> is designed with privacy as a core principle. This policy explains what data is (and is not) collected when you use the app.</p>

  <h2>Data Processing</h2>
  <p>Rewire does not require an account and does not collect personal information such as your name, email address, location, contacts, or identifiers.</p>
  <p>All focus sessions, app blocking rules, and usage decisions are processed on-device using Apple’s Screen Time APIs. This data is not transmitted to external servers.</p>

  <h2>Analytics and Tracking</h2>
  <p>Rewire collects limited, anonymous usage analytics to understand how the app is used and to improve reliability and performance.</p>
  <p>This data may include high-level information such as feature usage counts, session starts or ends, and app version. No data is used for advertising, profiling, or cross-app tracking.</p>
  <p>Rewire does not track users across apps or websites and does not use advertising identifiers.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Rewire is not directed at children under the age of 13. The app does not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>
  <p>If you believe that personal data has been provided by a child in error, please contact us and we will take appropriate steps to remove it.</p>
